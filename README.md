Plotting graphs using mathematical equations in C++

Used Graphics.h library in C++ for GUI and plotting of graphs

This program will help you in plotting different type of graphs.
The graphs which will be plotted are:
1. Trignometric.
2. Polar curves.
3. Spirals.
4. Exponential curves.
Instructions:
1. Double click a box of a graph type you need 
2. Go to console there it will ask you to enter the values of that particular graph.
3. Enter the values of graph.
4. After that there would come another window showing the plotted graph on the particular values. 
That would be your required graph.

Note: Enter the values according to the formulas to get the required curves.
Formula of cardiod: a+bsin/cos(theta).
Formula for lemicon: b(cos/sin*n(theta))^1/2.
